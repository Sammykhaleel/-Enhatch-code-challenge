  <h3>Solution:
  We have 10 villeges [villege(0)..villege(9)] i'd only take 9 villages let say [villege(1)..villege(9)], now we take number of bars from each villege that's equal to the villege(number/index) like below.</h3>
  <h3>villege(1) we take 1 bar.</h3>
  <h3>villege(4) we take 4 bars.</h3>
  <h3>villege(9) we take 9 bars.</h3>
  <h3>And that's going to give us 45 bars in total. Now we put the bars on the scale and that should give us 45 * 1000g = 45000g assuming no one of these 9 villeges cheated which mean villege(0) was cheating.
  else if the total was less than 45000 now we can determine which village by the deference in total e.g. if the total was 44996 that mean 45000-44996 = 4g which indicate that villege(4) becouse we toke 4 bars</h3>
